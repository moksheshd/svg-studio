# Current Sprint: Phase 0 - Demo MVP

**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS  
**Goal**: Create working demo with core path animation functionality  
**Timeline**: Week 0 (5-7 days estimated)  
**Started**: August 30, 2025  
**Phase Details**: [docs/phases/PHASE_0_DEMO_MVP.md](phases/PHASE_0_DEMO_MVP.md)

## Sprint Objective
Build a minimal viable demo that showcases the core concept of SVG Studio: importing an SVG, drawing a path, and animating the SVG along that path. This establishes the foundation for all subsequent development while delivering immediate value.

## Demo Requirements
The demo must demonstrate this complete workflow:
1. **Import SVG** - User drags & drops an SVG file
2. **Resize SVG** - User can resize the imported SVG
3. **Draw Path** - User clicks to create animation path points
4. **Play Animation** - User clicks play and SVG follows the path

## Active Tasks

### Phase 0.1: Foundation Setup (Days 1-2)
- [x] **Update camera system** âœ…
  - Replace PerspectiveCamera with OrthographicCamera in App.tsx
  - Position camera at (0, 0, 10) looking down at XY plane
  - Add basic zoom (mouse wheel) and pan (right-click drag)

- [x] **Implement basic SVG import** âœ…
  - Add drag & drop event handlers to canvas
  - File validation for .svg files
  - Basic error handling and user feedback
  - Auto-center imported SVG in viewport

- [x] **SVG processing and display** âœ…
  - Integrate Three.js SVGLoader
  - Convert SVG to Three.js geometry
  - Display in scene at Z=0
  - Basic styling preservation

### Phase 0.2: Interaction Tools (Days 3-4)
- [x] **Add resize functionality** âœ… Completed August 30, 2025
  - Create corner resize handles
  - Implement drag-to-resize logic
  - Maintain aspect ratio during resize (hold Shift for free resize)
  - Visual feedback during resize operation (handle highlighting)
  - Refined UI: Removed bounding box lines, kept only corner handles for cleaner look

- [x] **Build path drawing tool** âœ… Completed August 30, 2025
  - Toggle between normal and path-drawing modes
  - Click-to-add-point functionality
  - Visual path representation (line geometry)
  - Path point editing (drag to move, right-click to remove)
  - Clear path functionality
  - Visual feedback with hover highlighting

### Phase 0.3: Animation & Controls (Days 5-7)
- [x] **Integrate GSAP animation** âœ… Completed August 30, 2025
  - Set up GSAP with Timeline API
  - Convert drawn path to GSAP-compatible format
  - Implement smooth path following animation
  - Handle animation timing and easing
  - Auto-rotation to face movement direction

- [x] **Add playback controls** âœ… Completed August 30, 2025
  - Play/pause button
  - Reset to start position
  - Animation speed control (0.5x to 3x)
  - Dynamic UI that shows controls when path is ready

- [x] **Demo polish and testing** âœ… In Progress
  - Test with various SVG files
  - Smooth user experience flow
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Performance optimization
  - Fixed: SVG rotation issue - added optional auto-rotate toggle

## Definition of Done
- [x] User can drag & drop SVG file and see it displayed âœ…
- [x] User can resize SVG using corner handles âœ…
- [x] User can enter path drawing mode and click to add points âœ…
- [x] User can see visual path connecting the points âœ…
- [x] User can click play and watch SVG smoothly follow the path âœ…
- [x] User can reset animation to start position âœ…
- [x] Demo workflow completes in under 30 seconds âœ…
- [x] Works with common SVG files (icons, simple illustrations) âœ…

## Current Blockers
*None*

## Recent Updates
- **August 30, 2025**: Phase 0.2 & 0.3 Implementation
  - **Phase 0.2 - Interaction Tools**: âœ… Complete
    - Resize functionality with corner handles
    - Path drawing tool with point manipulation
    - Visual feedback and intuitive controls
  - **Phase 0.3 - Animation & Controls**: âœ… Complete
    - GSAP animation integration with Timeline API
    - Smooth path-following animation
    - Play/Pause/Reset controls
    - Animation speed control (0.5x-3x)
    - Optional auto-rotation to face movement direction
    - Segment-based timing for natural movement
  - **Bug Fixes**:
    - Fixed unwanted SVG rotation during animation
    - Added checkbox to optionally enable auto-rotation

## Notes
- Focus on Three.js SVGLoader over manual DOM parsing for robustness
- OrthographicCamera essential for true 2D feel without perspective distortion âœ… Implemented
- Consider performance implications for large SVG files
- Camera controls implemented: Mouse wheel zoom (0.1x-10x), right-click pan

## Technical Decisions Made
- **OrthographicCamera**: Implemented with frustum size 10 for proper 2D workspace
- **Camera Controls**: Zoom with mouse wheel, pan with right-click drag
- **State Management**: Using useRef for camera control states to avoid React re-renders
- **Architecture Pattern**: Separated concerns with SceneManager and SVGProcessor classes
- **SVG Import**: Using Three.js SVGLoader from 'three/addons/loaders/SVGLoader.js'
- **Coordinate System**: Properly handling SVG Y-axis flip for Three.js compatibility

## Next Sprint Preview
Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 will focus on element selection and interaction for animation targeting.
