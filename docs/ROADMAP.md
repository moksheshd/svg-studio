# SVG Studio Roadmap

## üéØ Project Vision
A pure SVG animation tool where users import existing SVG files and add motion, effects, and timing. No editing of SVG content - just animation layers on top.

## üìÖ Timeline Overview
- **Phase 0**: Demo MVP (Week 0) - NEW
- **Phase 1**: SVG Import & Display (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Animation Targeting (Week 2)  
- **Phase 3**: Effects Library (Week 3)
- **Phase 4**: Timeline & Controls (Week 4)

---

## ‚è≥ PHASE 0: Demo MVP (READY TO START)
**Goal**: Create working demo with core path animation functionality  
**Success Criteria**: User can import SVG, resize it, draw path, and animate along path  
**Timeline**: Week 0 (5-7 days estimated)  
**Details**: [docs/phases/PHASE_0_DEMO_MVP.md](phases/PHASE_0_DEMO_MVP.md)

### Key Deliverables
- Basic SVG import and display
- Simple resize functionality
- Path drawing tool (click to add points)
- GSAP path following animation
- Play/pause controls

---

## ‚è≥ PHASE 1: SVG Import & Display (PLANNED)
**Goal**: Users can import and view SVG files in a 2D workspace  
**Success Criteria**: User can drag & drop SVG and see it rendered with navigation  
**Timeline**: Week 1 (7 days estimated)  
**Details**: [docs/phases/PHASE_1_SVG_IMPORT.md](phases/PHASE_1_SVG_IMPORT.md)

### Key Deliverables
- Orthographic camera for true 2D view
- SVG file import with drag & drop
- Three.js rendering of SVG elements
- Basic workspace navigation (zoom, pan, grid)

---

## ‚è≥ PHASE 2: Animation Targeting (PLANNED)
**Goal**: Users can select SVG elements for animation  
**Success Criteria**: User can click and select individual elements  
**Timeline**: Week 2 (5 days estimated)  
**Details**: [docs/phases/PHASE_2_ANIMATION_TARGETING.md](phases/PHASE_2_ANIMATION_TARGETING.md)

### Key Deliverables
- Element selection with raycasting
- Visual highlight for selected elements
- SVG structure panel showing hierarchy
- Multi-select capability

---

## ‚è≥ PHASE 3: Effects Library (PLANNED)
**Goal**: Users can apply animation effects to selected elements  
**Success Criteria**: User can apply entrance, motion, and transform effects  
**Timeline**: Week 3 (7 days estimated)  
**Details**: [docs/phases/PHASE_3_EFFECTS_LIBRARY.md](phases/PHASE_3_EFFECTS_LIBRARY.md)

### Key Deliverables
- Entrance effects (fade in, slide in, draw on)
- Motion effects (path following, floating)
- Transform effects (scale, rotate, position)
- Effect preview system

---

## ‚è≥ PHASE 4: Timeline & Controls (PLANNED)
**Goal**: Users can control timing and sequencing of animations  
**Success Criteria**: User can sequence animations and control playback  
**Timeline**: Week 4 (5 days estimated)  
**Details**: [docs/phases/PHASE_4_TIMELINE_CONTROLS.md](phases/PHASE_4_TIMELINE_CONTROLS.md)

### Key Deliverables
- Animation timeline with multiple tracks
- Playback controls (play, pause, scrub)
- Sequencing and delay controls
- Loop and repeat options

---

## üìä Progress Summary
- **Total Phases**: 5 (including Demo MVP)
- **Completed**: 0
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Planned**: 5
- **Estimated Timeline**: 5 weeks (Demo + 4 development weeks)

## üéØ Success Metrics
- **Week 0**: Working demo with SVG import, resize, path drawing, and animation
- **Week 1**: Enhanced SVG import and workspace features
- **Week 2**: Can select individual SVG elements
- **Week 3**: Can apply animation effects
- **Week 4**: Can control timing and sequencing

## üîÑ Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 0: Demo MVP
2. Set up orthographic camera and basic scene
3. Implement basic SVG import functionality
4. Create path drawing and animation system
