# PHASE 4: Timeline & Controls

**Status**: ‚è≥ Planned  
**Goal**: Users can control timing and sequencing of animations  
**Timeline**: Week 4 (5 days estimated)  
**Previous Phase**: [PHASE_3_EFFECTS_LIBRARY.md](PHASE_3_EFFECTS_LIBRARY.md)

## Overview
Build comprehensive timeline controls and sequencing capabilities that allow users to precisely time, coordinate, and control multiple animations. This phase completes the core SVG animation functionality.

## Technical Requirements

### Timeline System
- Visual timeline interface with multiple tracks
- Drag-and-drop timeline editing
- Keyframe management and visualization
- Timeline zoom and navigation controls

### Playback Controls
- Play, pause, stop, restart functionality
- Timeline scrubbing for precise positioning
- Speed control (0.1x to 5x playback speed)
- Loop and repeat options

### Sequencing Features
- Animation delay and offset controls
- Stagger effects for multiple elements
- Sequential vs simultaneous animation modes
- Animation grouping and coordination

## Detailed Tasks

### Timeline Interface Development
- [ ] **Create visual timeline component**
  - Horizontal timeline with time markers
  - Multiple tracks for different elements/effects
  - Drag-and-drop interface for timing adjustments
  - Zoom controls for detailed editing

- [ ] **Implement timeline navigation**
  - Playhead scrubbing with mouse interaction
  - Keyboard shortcuts for frame-by-frame navigation
  - Timeline zoom in/out for precision editing
  - Auto-scroll to follow playhead during playback

- [ ] **Add keyframe visualization**
  - Visual markers for animation start/end points
  - Effect duration bars on timeline tracks
  - Keyframe editing with drag handles
  - Visual feedback for timing conflicts

### Playback Control System
- [ ] **Build playback controls UI**
  - Play/pause button with state indication
  - Stop button to reset to beginning
  - Restart button for quick replay
  - Progress indicator showing current position

- [ ] **Implement timeline scrubbing**
  - Click-to-seek functionality on timeline
  - Drag playhead for smooth scrubbing
  - Real-time preview during scrubbing
  - Snap-to-keyframe option for precision

- [ ] **Add speed control**
  - Speed slider (0.1x to 5x)
  - Preset speed buttons (0.5x, 1x, 2x)
  - Maintain animation quality at different speeds
  - Speed indicator in UI

- [ ] **Create loop and repeat options**
  - Loop entire animation option
  - Bounce (forward then reverse) mode
  - Play once and stop mode
  - Custom loop count setting

### Animation Sequencing
- [ ] **Implement delay and offset controls**
  - Per-effect delay settings
  - Global timeline offset adjustments
  - Visual delay indicators on timeline
  - Negative delays for overlapping effects

- [ ] **Add stagger effects**
  - Automatic stagger for multiple selected elements
  - Configurable stagger timing and direction
  - Stagger preview with visual feedback
  - Random stagger option for organic feel

- [ ] **Build animation grouping**
  - Group related animations for coordinated control
  - Group playback controls
  - Nested timeline support for complex sequences
  - Group timing adjustments

### Advanced Timeline Features
- [ ] **Add timeline markers and labels**
  - Custom markers for important timing points
  - Label system for organizing complex timelines
  - Marker snapping for precise alignment
  - Export markers for reference

- [ ] **Implement timeline layers**
  - Separate layers for different animation types
  - Layer visibility controls
  - Layer locking to prevent accidental edits
  - Layer reordering for animation priority

## Technical Decisions

### Timeline Architecture
- React components for UI with Three.js/GSAP integration
- Separate timeline state from animation execution
- Efficient updates for real-time scrubbing
- Modular design for future timeline features

### Performance Optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large timelines
- Efficient rendering of timeline elements
- Debounced updates during scrubbing
- Memory management for complex sequences

### User Experience Design
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interactions
- Clear visual feedback for all operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] User can see visual timeline with animation tracks
- [ ] Playback controls (play, pause, stop) work correctly
- [ ] Timeline scrubbing provides real-time preview
- [ ] Speed control adjusts playback rate smoothly
- [ ] Loop and repeat modes function properly
- [ ] Animation delays and offsets are adjustable
- [ ] Stagger effects work with multiple elements
- [ ] Timeline editing is intuitive and responsive
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with complex timelines

## Testing Requirements
- Test timeline with various animation combinations
- Verify scrubbing accuracy and performance
- Test playback controls with different animation types
- Ensure stagger effects work correctly
- Test timeline editing with drag-and-drop
- Verify performance with long, complex timelines

## Timeline Interface Specifications

### Visual Design
- **Track Height**: 40px per animation track
- **Time Markers**: Every 0.5 seconds with labels
- **Playhead**: Red line with drag handle
- **Effect Bars**: Color-coded by effect type
- **Zoom Range**: 0.1x to 10x timeline scale

### Interaction Patterns
- **Click Timeline**: Seek to position
- **Drag Playhead**: Scrub through animation
- **Drag Effect Bar**: Adjust timing and duration
- **Double-click**: Add marker or edit label
- **Scroll**: Pan timeline horizontally

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Spacebar**: Play/pause toggle
- **Home**: Jump to beginning
- **End**: Jump to end
- **Left/Right Arrows**: Frame-by-frame navigation
- **+/-**: Zoom in/out timeline

## Notes & Decisions
- Timeline state synchronized with GSAP master timeline
- Scrubbing uses GSAP's seek functionality for accuracy
- Timeline zoom affects visual scale, not animation timing
- Effect bars show visual duration, not just keyframes

## Lessons Learned
*(To be filled as phase progresses)*

## Project Completion
This phase completes the core SVG animation functionality, providing users with a complete tool for importing SVGs and creating sophisticated animations with precise timing control.
