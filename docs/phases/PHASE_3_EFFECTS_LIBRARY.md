# PHASE 3: Effects Library

**Status**: ⏳ Planned  
**Goal**: Users can apply animation effects to selected SVG elements  
**Timeline**: Week 3 (7 days estimated)  
**Previous Phase**: [PHASE_2_ANIMATION_TARGETING.md](PHASE_2_ANIMATION_TARGETING.md)  
**Next Phase**: [PHASE_4_TIMELINE_CONTROLS.md](PHASE_4_TIMELINE_CONTROLS.md)

## Overview
Build a comprehensive library of animation effects that can be applied to selected SVG elements. Focus on entrance effects, motion effects, and transform effects using GSAP for smooth animations.

## Technical Requirements

### Animation Engine Integration
- GSAP integration for smooth, performant animations
- MotionPathPlugin for path-following animations
- Timeline management for effect sequencing
- Easing and timing control systems

### Effect Categories
- **Entrance Effects**: Fade in, slide in, scale up, draw on
- **Motion Effects**: Path following, floating, orbital motion
- **Transform Effects**: Scale, rotate, position, skew
- **Continuous Effects**: Pulse, spin, bounce, hover

### Effect Management
- Effect preview system for real-time feedback
- Effect parameter customization (duration, easing, etc.)
- Multiple effects per element support
- Effect removal and modification capabilities

## Detailed Tasks

### GSAP Integration
- [ ] **Set up GSAP animation system**
  - Configure GSAP with MotionPathPlugin
  - Create animation manager for effect coordination
  - Set up timeline management for complex sequences
  - Implement performance monitoring for animations

- [ ] **Create effect base classes**
  - Abstract Effect class with common properties
  - EntranceEffect, MotionEffect, TransformEffect subclasses
  - Effect parameter validation and defaults
  - Effect lifecycle management (start, pause, stop, reset)

### Entrance Effects Implementation
- [ ] **Fade In effect**
  - Animate opacity from 0 to original value
  - Configurable duration and easing
  - Support for delay and stagger options

- [ ] **Slide In effects**
  - Slide from left, right, top, bottom
  - Animate position with smooth easing
  - Maintain original position as target

- [ ] **Scale Up effect**
  - Animate scale from 0 to 1
  - Transform origin options (center, corner, custom)
  - Elastic and bounce easing options

- [ ] **Draw On effect (for paths)**
  - Animate stroke-dasharray for drawing effect
  - Calculate path length for accurate timing
  - Support for drawing direction (forward/reverse)

### Motion Effects Implementation
- [ ] **Path Following animation**
  - Convert SVG paths to GSAP MotionPath format
  - Animate objects along selected path elements
  - Configurable speed and direction
  - Auto-rotation to follow path direction

- [ ] **Floating animation**
  - Subtle up/down or side-to-side motion
  - Configurable amplitude and frequency
  - Infinite loop with smooth transitions

- [ ] **Orbital motion**
  - Circular or elliptical motion around center point
  - Configurable radius, speed, and direction
  - Custom center point selection

### Transform Effects Implementation
- [ ] **Scale animation**
  - Scale up/down with configurable factors
  - Transform origin options
  - Bounce and elastic easing support

- [ ] **Rotation animation**
  - Rotate around center or custom pivot point
  - Configurable angle and direction
  - Continuous rotation options

- [ ] **Position animation**
  - Move elements to specific coordinates
  - Relative movement options
  - Smooth path interpolation

### Effect Management System
- [ ] **Effect preview system**
  - Real-time preview while adjusting parameters
  - Play/pause preview functionality
  - Preview without affecting main timeline

- [ ] **Effect parameter controls**
  - Duration slider (0.1s to 10s)
  - Easing selection (ease, bounce, elastic, etc.)
  - Delay and stagger controls
  - Effect intensity/amplitude controls

- [ ] **Multiple effects per element**
  - Effect stacking and combination
  - Effect priority and conflict resolution
  - Sequential vs simultaneous effect execution

## Technical Decisions

### Why GSAP?
- Industry-standard animation library with excellent performance
- MotionPathPlugin perfect for SVG path animations
- Rich easing options and timeline management
- Better performance than CSS animations for complex sequences

### Effect Architecture
- Plugin-based system for easy extension
- Consistent parameter interface across all effects
- Separation of effect logic from UI controls
- Efficient memory management for multiple effects

### Performance Optimization
- Effect pooling for frequently used animations
- Lazy loading of complex effects
- GPU acceleration where possible
- Efficient cleanup of completed animations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] User can apply entrance effects to selected elements
- [ ] Motion effects work with SVG path elements
- [ ] Transform effects provide smooth animations
- [ ] Effect parameters are adjustable in real-time
- [ ] Multiple effects can be applied to single elements
- [ ] Effect preview system works without affecting main timeline
- [ ] Performance remains smooth with multiple active effects
- [ ] Effects can be removed and modified after application

## Testing Requirements
- Test all effect types with various SVG elements
- Verify effect parameter controls work correctly
- Test multiple effects on single elements
- Ensure effect preview doesn't interfere with main animations
- Test performance with many simultaneous effects
- Verify effect cleanup and memory management

## Effect Library Specifications

### Entrance Effects
- **Fade In**: opacity 0→1, duration 0.5s default
- **Slide In Left**: translateX -100px→0, duration 0.8s
- **Slide In Right**: translateX 100px→0, duration 0.8s
- **Slide In Up**: translateY 100px→0, duration 0.8s
- **Slide In Down**: translateY -100px→0, duration 0.8s
- **Scale Up**: scale 0→1, duration 0.6s, elastic easing
- **Draw On**: stroke-dasharray animation, duration based on path length

### Motion Effects
- **Path Follow**: object follows SVG path, configurable speed
- **Float**: subtle Y-axis motion, ±10px amplitude, 2s cycle
- **Orbit**: circular motion, configurable radius and speed

### Transform Effects
- **Scale Pulse**: scale 1→1.1→1, 1s cycle, infinite
- **Rotate**: continuous rotation, configurable speed
- **Position**: move to target coordinates, smooth easing

## Notes & Decisions
- Effect parameters stored with element for persistence
- Preview mode uses separate GSAP timeline
- Effect conflicts resolved by priority system
- GPU acceleration enabled for transform effects

## Lessons Learned
*(To be filled as phase progresses)*

## Next Phase Preview
Phase 4 will add timeline controls and sequencing capabilities, allowing users to precisely time and coordinate multiple effects.
