## Plugin Architecture Design

### Core System Components
- **Canvas Engine** - Three.js scene management, rendering pipeline
- **Plugin Manager** - Plugin lifecycle, registration, communication
- **Event System** - Unified event handling across all plugins
- **State Manager** - Global application state and plugin state isolation
- **API Layer** - Standardized plugin interface and core functionality access

### Plugin Types
- **Tool Plugins** - Interactive canvas tools (Path, Selection, Shapes, etc.)
- **Panel Plugins** - UI panels (Properties, Timeline, Layers, etc.)
- **Export Plugins** - File format handlers (SVG, PNG, JSON, etc.)
- **Animation Plugins** - Different animation engines (GSAP, CSS, WebGL, etc.)
- **Theme Plugins** - UI customization and branding
- **Integration Plugins** - External service connectors (Cloud storage, APIs, etc.)

### Plugin Communication
- **Event Bus** - Plugin-to-plugin messaging system
- **Shared State** - Controlled access to global application state
- **API Hooks** - Core functionality exposure to plugins
- **Resource Sharing** - Asset and utility sharing between plugins

### Key Dependencies
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering and scene management
- **GSAP**: Animation engine with MotionPathPlugin
- **React**: UI framework and state management
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for plugin interfaces

### Plugin Development Guidelines
- All plugins must implement BasePlugin interface
- Plugins should be self-contained with minimal dependencies
- Use event system for plugin communication
- Follow naming conventions for plugin discovery
- Include plugin metadata for marketplace integration

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of plugins to reduce initial bundle size
- Plugin sandboxing to prevent performance degradation
- Efficient event system to minimize overhead
- Resource pooling for graphics objects
- Optimized rendering pipeline for smooth interactions

## Progress: 3/19 tasks completed (16%)

## Next Steps
1. Design comprehensive plugin architecture
2. Build core engine and plugin manager
3. Implement first tool plugin (Path Tool)
4. Create UI plugin system
5. Establish plugin marketplace foundation

## Vision
Transform SVG Studio into a comprehensive, extensible platform for SVG creation and animation that can compete with professional tools while maintaining simplicity and performance. The plugin architecture will enable unlimited feature expansion and community-driven development.
